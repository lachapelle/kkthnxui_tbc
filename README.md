KkthnxUI is a modular, lightweight, all-in-one overhaul for the World of Warcraft interface. It aims to streamline and clean up the interface, removing unnecessary frills and wasted space as well as fill in some of the holes left in the default UI.      

### Infomation   
* **Setup** - All settings are changed in the file KkthnxUI\Config\Settings.lua or in-game options(/cfg).   
* **Screen Resolution** - All resolutions above 1280 pixels horizontally.   
* **Screen mode** - Full screen.   

### Installation   
* Delete/backup your current UI.   
* Copy all from archive to your World of Warcraft folder(WoW\Interface\AddOns\)
* Put these files  in `...C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft 3.3.5` Or where ever you have your World of Warcraft installed. You get the idea.   

### F.A.Q   
* All questions, suggestions and bugs can be directed to me in-game or in a issues report too [Link](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI-3.3.5/issues/new)   
* Once You get in-game you will be prompted with an install feature. Accept it.      
* Once the UI reloads off the install, you can type **/settings** or **/settings all** if you prefer all the settings for addon profiles.   
* You can type /moveui and move certain features of the UI. More to come later.   
* I am not responsible if you break your old UI due to putting mine on!   
* If you do not like something about my UI... [Well I can not please everyone](http://puu.sh/k0Hki.jpg).     
* I took time out of my life to do this, take time out of your life to say thank you!   
* If you find a bug, then properly make a bug [report](https://github.com/Kkthnx/KkthnxUI-3.3.5/issues/new).   
* Enjoy the UI and be happy.
* Donations are welcome, but not required to use the UI at all. Donations help me further my development and fuel my gaming! Donations will never be a requirement!
